# woda

woda is browser acceptance framework for clojure. It's inspired by [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [abrade](https://github.com/weavejester/abrade)

## Usage

Here's a quick example of using woda with midje (taken from [woda's tests](test source)):

```lisp

   (facts "about selecting element by id"
        (-> (visit "http://localhost:8008")
            (page-get-element-by-id "subtitle")
            (content)) => "This is a subtitle"

        (-> (visit "http://localhost:8008")
            (page-get-element-by-id "NOT_EXISTING_ID")) => (throws ElementNotFoundException ))
```

## Available methods

- (visit url)
- (page-has? string)
- (page-get-element-by-id string)
- (click-link string)
- (fill-in field-id value)
- (click-button name)
